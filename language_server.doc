\title{language_server -- Python and Other Programming Languge Integration for SWI Prolog}
\author{Eric Zinda \\
	E-mail: \email{ericz@inductorsoftware.com}}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

This package provides the library \file{language_server.pl} that enables embedding SWI Prolog into just 
about any programming language (Python, Go, C#, etc) in a straightforward way. It is designed
for scenarios that need to use SWI Prolog as a local implementation detail of another language. 
Think of it as running SWI Prolog "like a library". It can support any programming language 
that can launch processes, read their STDOUT pipe, and send and receive JSON over TCP/IP. 
 
 A Python 3.x library is provided.
